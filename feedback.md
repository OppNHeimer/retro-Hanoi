## Notes

Great job with this project! The UI is really amazing. I was very picky on the JS and showed a lot of potential refactors. These are small changes that would improve your code's readability and some technical things. I would highly recommend learning SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) since it seems you are interested in fancy front end development -- it will make a bunch of your functionality easier. I would also highly recommend looking into model view separation for your app -- the separation of JQuery/DOM manipulation and game logic would be a good learning opportunity and would make your code more readable. Again **great** job, just keep working on making your JS really clean!
